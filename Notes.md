# Hacking With SwiftUI Notes

# Day 0

Working on Day 0.

Core Skills

- Swift
- SwiftUI
- Working with Data
- Networking
- Version Control

The only way to write great code is to write a whole bunch of bad code first.

SwiftUI uses Swift to build UI. Framework built on top of Swift.

Benefits of SwiftUI

- It is significantly easier than UIKit, with fewer things to learn along the way.
- Built for Swift. Takes care of some things behind the scenes. Unlike UIkit, that was built for ObjC
- Works on all platforms.
- SwiftUI is where things are going. It will be the dominant UI framework.

Networking is getting and sending data.

Working with data, getting data from a server, loading it, and showing it on the screen.

Version Control, using something like Git. It's about publishing your code somewhere.

## Swift

Extension Skills

- UIKit
- Core Data
- Testing
- Architecture
- Multithreading

Why UIKit?

- It's popular
- It's more powerful than SwiftUI
- It's precise
- It's proven, because it's been around longer.

Why Not UIKit?

- It's more complicated than SwiftUI.
- It's got features that hidden in SwiftUI
- Protocols and Delegates
- Nothing about AutoLayout is Auto.

Core Data

- Allows to store data
- Syncs to iCloud

Why not Core Data?

- It's freaking complicated
- Does not feel comfortable in Swift
- Surprisingly complex

Testing is an extension not a core skill. iOS community is bad at Testing. Big apps have like no tests. Writing tests don't seem as much fun. Testing is a smaller topic, theoretically.

Software Architecture comes with experience:

- Design Patterns

Multithreading -> headache for our brain to work. Goal is understand enough without going a great deal forward.

Common Mistakes:

1. Memorizing everything
2. Shiny object syndrome
3. lone wolf learning
4. Using beta software
5. Relying on Apple's Documentation
6. Learning Objective C
7. Taking Shots at others languages

Memorizing Everything, do not do it. It will suck all your willpower out of you. No one memorizes everything. Learn how to look it back up. The more you look up the more you will remember. You learn through repetition. The more you relearn you make it clear to your brain that this topic matters. This is worth stashing away. Don't worry about forgetting things. Know where to look. **ps, this is why i'm taking notes**.

Shiny Object syndrome. Learning lots of material isn't exciting. Some things give you great results; others take a long time to understand.

Lone Wolfing is about learning by yourself. Extremely easy to lose motivation this way. Share what you are learning.

Using Beta Versions. I don't need to be cautioned on this. So much is just wrong.

### Debrief from the day

Much of this material was review for me. I already know a lot about swift and a little about SwiftUI. I've worked with Apple's Developer Documentation for years and know it's pitfalls.

In general, I like Paul, love his dogs, and his teaching style.

Bigger issue I think I'm going to have is sticking with it when I get bored. Too much review.
